# *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*

This will be a compiliation of various figures and exercises from Barto and Suttons book *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.* There are a few versions of this book floating around, one is available on his [website](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2017june19.pdf), which is the most up-to-date working version (at the time of this writing). Googling the book title could yield a few more, and there is the version that is formally published available [here](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation/dp/0262193981), however this is the original version published in 1998.

For the sake of this walkthrough, we'll be using the one available online at Dr. Suttons website, as its the most up-to-date version.

As a very blunt, up-front disclaimer: none of the information that follows is original research, and I am not claiming it as such. The only thing I did was generate the code to show the book examples and explain my thoughts and understanding in the comments for the sections. 

### [Chapter 2: Multi-Arm Bandits](http://people.tamu.edu/~levimcclenny/project/reinforcement-learning/Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter2.html)
This section of the book is dedicated to framing the optimal control and award maximization principles via an illustration though the "multi-armed bandit." More is discussed in the Chapter 2 [Jupyter Notebook file](http://people.tamu.edu/~levimcclenny/project/reinforcement-learning/Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter2.html). 

### [Chapter 3: Finite Markov Decision Processes](http://people.tamu.edu/~levimcclenny/project/reinforcement-learning/Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter3.html)
Here we begin to formulate the reinforcement learning problem, starting with markov chains and moving into Markov Decision Processes. We evaluate random and optimal value functions using the Gridworld example outlined in the text. More is discussed in the accompanying [Jupyter Notebook file](http://people.tamu.edu/~levimcclenny/project/reinforcement-learning/Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter3.html).
