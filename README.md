# *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*

One text that is widely regarded as the "industry standard" in Reinforcement Learning is Sutton and Barto's *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.* Here you will find the supporting source code for the jupyter notebooks found on [my website](http://people.tamu.edu/~levimcclenny/project/reinforcement-learning/), as well as in the links below. My hope is that the code and the insights offered in these notebooks will help a causal reader better understand the power of reinforcement learning. 

### [Multi-Arm Bandits](Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter2.html)
This section of the book is dedicated to framing the optimal control and award maximization principles via an illustration though the "multi-armed bandit." More is discussed in the [Jupyter Notebook](Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter2.html). The standalone python source code can be found [here](https://github.com/levimcclenny/Reinforcement_Learning).

### [Finite Markov Decision Processes](Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter3.html)
Here we begin to formulate the reinforcement learning problem, starting with markov chains and moving into Markov Decision Processes. We evaluate random and optimal value functions using the Gridworld example outlined in the text. Some of the more important takeaways are outlined in the [Jupyter Notebook](Barto_Sutton_RL/Chapter3.html) file and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/levimcclenny/Reinforcement_Learning).




Obligatory disclaimer: This is not original research, but rather my insights into this incredible book.
